As of the requirement you don't need any pre-installations to run and test the assignment. 
Steps:-
 * Simply unzip the folder. Make sure all the files are in one folder.
 * You can double click on index.html to open the assignment in a server or if you want the visualization of the code then open in VS Code.
 * Make sure you have installed the Extension (Live Server).
 * Right Click on your mouse and click on Open with Live server.
 * Done! The assignment is visual and functional.
N.B: I could've added the routing/hosting via PhP or React but as It wasn't mentioned in the question, I skipped it for ensuring testing friendliness.
